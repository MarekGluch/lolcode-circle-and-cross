# lolcode-circle-and-cross
I've wanted to write code in some esoteric programming language for a long time. I was wondering about lolcode, brainfuck and php. Ultimately I chose lolcode because it seems to have the most mature syntax

## DEMO?
Come here to see the [demo](https://replit.com/@MarekGluch/lolcode-circle-and-cross#main.lol)

You can also use an online compiler to see the result of this code (for example this one: [lolcode online compiler](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_lolcode_online.php))
